# stormtracker
Storm Tracker is a simplified version of a powerful algorithm I developed called SCAFET, (short for Scalable Feature Extraction and Tracking). While SCAFET is designed to detect and track a wide range of weather patterns in complex climate data, Storm Tracker focuses specifically on identifying and following storms in real time.
